# Random-Walks
This notebook was part of my scientific computing module. It contains the main Jupyter Notebook and an Excel spreadsheet needed to make a random walk around the words "RANDOM WALK".

As an extra side project, attempts were made to try to find the amount of self avoiding random walks in a (m,n) grid starting from (0,0) and ending at (m,n) as described here: https://oeis.org/wiki/Self-avoiding_walks via brute force.
